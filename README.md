# Automation Scripts Collection

Welcome to my collection of automation scripts! This repository is dedicated to sharing the tools I've developed to make life easier by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Whether it's managing unwanted group conversations in messaging apps or performing batch operations that save you hours, you'll find a range of scripts here aimed at boosting your productivity.

## What's Inside

The repository is organized into directories based on the type of automation each script provides, such as web automation, file management, or specific applications like Skype. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

- **Web Automation**: Scripts designed to automate web browsing tasks, filling forms, and managing online content.
- **Skype Conversation Management**: A specific solution for batch leaving Skype group conversations, a common nuisance without a native batch processing option.
- **File Management**: Automate the organization, renaming, and management of files on your computer.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you'll typically need:

- A basic understanding of the scripting language used (most commonly JavaScript or Python).
- The appropriate environment or interpreter for running the scripts (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript, Python interpreter for Python scripts).
- Any specific dependencies or libraries mentioned in the script comments or documentation.
