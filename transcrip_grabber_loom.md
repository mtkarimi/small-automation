This JavaScript snippet is designed to automate the process of scrolling through a scrollable container on a webpage and collecting textual content from specified elements within that container. It targets a container with a specific style attribute indicative of its role as a scrollable area. The script initializes variables to store collected texts, the total number of content cues (transcript rows) to be collected, and the ID of the last collected cue to track progress and avoid duplicates.

The main functionalities include:

1. **Auto-Scrolling**: Simulates user scrolling within the specified container by programmatically adjusting the container's `scrollTop` property. This is essential for triggering any lazy-loaded content or simply navigating through the content that extends beyond the initial viewport.

2. **Text Collection**: As it scrolls, the script identifies elements by a `data-testid` attribute that follows the pattern `transcript-row-<number>`. For each identified element, it then queries for a nested span containing the transcript text, extracts its textual content, and stores it in an array.

3. **Logging**: Outputs collected text to the console, providing a straightforward way to review or further process the collected data.

The process begins by executing the `autoScroll` function, which also handles the invocation of the `collectTexts` function after each scroll action. The scrolling and text collection continue until the script has either collected text from the number of cues specified by the `totalCues` variable or reached the end of the scrollable area. Adjustments to the scroll step size, delay between scrolls, and the total number of cues can be made to cater to the specific webpage layout and loading behavior.
